# Power-BI-Project
In the course of this project, I engaged with a comprehensive survey dataset sourced from data science professionals. The focal point of my efforts revolved around meticulous data cleaning using a suite of powerful tools provided by Power BI. This involved employing techniques such as splitting columns by delimiter, strategically removing unnecessary columns, adeptly replacing values to enhance data accuracy, and ingeniously creating custom columns tailored to the specific project requirements.

Notably, the project extends beyond mere data cleaning, encompassing the proficient utilization of Power BI's robust visualization tools. These tools facilitate insightful data exploration, enabling a deeper understanding of patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Through the seamless integration of data cleaning and visualization, this project not only ensures the reliability of the dataset but also empowers users to derive meaningful insights from the data.
